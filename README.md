# Client-Server-Dashboard

1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
In developing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, one key strategy is to modularize the code into separate components, each responsible for a specific task. This approach was evident in the CRUD Python module developed for Project One, which served as the interface between the dashboard widgets and the database in Project Two. By abstracting the database operations into reusable functions, the code became more readable and maintainable, as changes to the database interactions could be made in one place.
Working in this modular way also allowed for greater adaptability. For example, the CRUD module could easily be extended to handle additional database operations or connect to different types of databases. This flexibility is essential in real-world applications where requirements may change over time.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks, and then systematically solving each task. This approach was evident in the development of the dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare. Rather than trying to tackle the entire project at once, the dashboard was built iteratively, with each component tested and refined before moving on to the next.
This project differed from previous assignments in other courses by emphasizing real-world application development. Rather than focusing solely on the theoretical aspects of computer science, the project required practical skills in database management, web development, and data visualization. To create databases to meet other client requests in the future, similar strategies could be employed, such as gathering requirements, designing a data model, implementing the database, and testing it thoroughly before deployment.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists play a crucial role in helping companies like Grazioso Salvare improve their work through technology. By developing tools like the dashboard, which provide insights into their data and facilitate decision-making, computer scientists enable companies to operate more efficiently and effectively. In this project, the dashboard provided Grazioso Salvare with a user-friendly interface to interact with their animal shelter data, helping them better manage their operations and serve their community.
